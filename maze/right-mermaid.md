You swam stupidly into the river and those dark figures you ignored a while ago swim right up to you.

They turn out to be hauntingly pretty mermaids.

You reach out to touch a strand of long green hair but as soon as you touch it she grabs you by the throat and pulls you under. 

You've been drowned and lose to the maze.
